# cch

Cloud CLI for Humans

Very simple cloud CLI, specifically designed for human interaction.

Just type `mkvm` and it will help you step-by-step create a virtual machine, by
first letting you provide a flavor from availale flavors, then similarly a
security group, and then root volume storage.  All the other commands are just
as simple!


# Installation

Simply run:

    $ pip install cch

To use it:

    $ cch --help
